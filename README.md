8 linux installations later, I had Kubuntu up and running again.  Optimus support is rough...

If we don't count the time that I spent trying to get my system configured again, I would say that this homework took me 2-3 hours.  I did manage to get some interesting information on performance though.  It is possible to turn vsync off in google chrome.  When I did this, my framerate went up to almost 100fps.
